    "Adam mentioned how he is building a software some days and how he tests it. He also said and I agree how it is very important to know the social science aspect of the field. The behavior of the robot and how humans react to them. How the person looking on one side of road has to be made alert by honking since he's looking other way and the robot does not notice this. There will be different inputs required to make this more accurate. All these things to listen were so fascinating. "

    "I think jupyter notebooks are really very helpful especially for students who are newly learning to code. Along with the students, professionals also can create their code, write a proper description cell by cell and make it easily readavble. I am exited to work via notebbok on Github since it is a free open source platform. It gives the flexibility to learn from others' code as well as to publish own work to the world to see."
